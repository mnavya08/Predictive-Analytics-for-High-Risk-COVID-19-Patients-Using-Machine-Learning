# 🧠 Predictive Modeling of High-Risk COVID-19 Patients Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project leverages **Cerner's Real-World Data (CRWD)** to build predictive machine learning models that identify high-risk COVID-19 patients at the time of hospital admission. The model aims to support healthcare providers in making informed, early decisions to allocate resources efficiently and improve patient outcomes during pandemic situations.

> 🔍 **Key Goal**: Predict whether a patient is at high risk of mortality or ICU admission using only the data available **at the time of hospital encounter**.

## 🧾 Problem Statement

> **How can we accurately identify COVID-19 patients at higher risk of severe outcomes (death or ICU) using only pre-admission features from hospital data?**

Predicting early helps clinicians make timely interventions and manage hospital capacity during pandemics.

## 📊 Data Preprocessing

- Removed post-admission, identifier, and sparse (>70% missing) columns.
- Handled missing values using **KNN Imputer** after verifying with **Little's MCAR test**.
- Encoded categorical variables and mapped ICD disease codes for interpretability.
- Balanced the binary target variable (`deceased`) using **SMOTE + undersampling**.

## 🔍 Model Interpretability with SHAP

Used SHAP to explain model decisions:

- Global feature importance plots
- SHAP Summary Plot
- Feature value impacts

**Top Predictors**:
- Genitourinary diseases
- Encounter route & type
- Parasitic/Respiratory conditions
- Age at encounter.
